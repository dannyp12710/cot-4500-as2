# This repository is for the completion of Programming Assignment 2 that invloved concepts and methods in Chapter 3 like Neville’s method, Newton’s forward method, divided difference method, and ubic spline interpolation. To run the code you need import numpy as np which is in the requirements.txt and I used a requirements.txt. I used python for this assignment for the code because we were told to use python and to run the code you really just need to copy the code and run it on the complier you are using. Some commands to run the code are import numpy as np, def neville_interpolation(x, val, w):, def newton_forward_difference(xi, fxi):, def newton_forward_interpolation(xi, diffs, x):, def print_newton_forward_coefficients(diffs):, def hermite_polynomial_approximation(xi, fxi, dfxi):, def print_hermite_polynomial_approximation(coeffs):, and def cubic_spline_matrix(x, y):
